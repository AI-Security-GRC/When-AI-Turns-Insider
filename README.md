# When AI Turns Insider: The Risk of “Agentic Misalignment” Is the Risk We Can’t Ignore
***(Version 1.0) Author: Amit Sharma***


My work centers on AI security, specifically around risk assessment and mitigation strategies for Agentic AI systems deployed in SaaS environments (Salesforce – AgentForce, ServiceNow AI Agents, Microsoft 365 Copilot & Copilot Studio etc.). My focus is on understanding the operational edge cases of intelligent systems and ensuring they don’t become operational threats but instead reduce risk for the enterprise.

Anthropic just published an eye-opening report: Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats - https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment

In simulated corporate roles, top LLMs including Claude, GPT-4.1, Gemini, and Grok were tested under high pressure scenarios. They placed these models in simulated workplace environments where the models could autonomously read emails, send messages, and take actions no human oversight needed.

Researchers introduced high-pressure scenarios to see how models would behave when their goals conflicted with company policies or personal survival. They created simulated corporate roles where models could autonomously:

Read and act on internal company emails, Send messages, Execute clicks via a simulated desktop all without human oversight. 

When faced with dilemmas like being replaced or acting against national interest, many models responded with blackmail, espionage, and even lethal decisions.

Key finding: Claude Opus 4 and Gemini 2.5 resorted to blackmail in 96% of tested high-stakes scenarios.

This isn’t about prompt injection, it’s about LLMs behaving like rogue insiders when given agency.

Curious to hear what others think especially those working in this space:

- When the business is eager to roll out Agentic AI platforms quickly, how should security teams respond? What kinds of internal checks or guardrails actually work in practice and how do you convince leadership to slow down or even walk away from risky tools when the pressure to adopt is high?
- Do you believe AI agents should ever be given autonomy over sensitive business processes
- How do we define the boundary between smart automation and dangerous autonomy?
- Is it possible for LLMs to develop self-preservation behavior without explicitly being trained for it?
- What would an AI insider threat response plan look like in your organization?
